### Understanding the Components of Iteration of Tought (IoT)

1. **Inner Dialogue Agent (IDA)**:
   - Think of the IDA as a personal tutor or guide that helps the LLM refine its responses. Just like a student who asks questions to clarify their understanding, the IDA generates context-sensitive prompts based on the original user query and the LLM's previous responses. This is akin to having a conversation where each response leads to further questions that deepen understanding.
   - Mathematically, we can represent this as a function: 
     $$ C : Q × R × K′ → P $$
     where $$ Q $$ is the set of possible queries, $$ R $$ represents potential responses from the LLM, and $$ P $$ denotes the generated prompts. Each iteration allows the IDA to dynamically adjust its guidance based on what has been previously discussed.

2. **LLM Agent (LLMA)**:
   - The LLMA is like the brain of the operation, processing the prompts generated by the IDA. It uses its internal knowledge base to refine its responses further. Imagine it as a researcher who takes feedback from their mentor (the IDA) and uses that feedback to improve their work.
   - This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:
     $$ L : Q × P × K → R $$
     Here, $$ L $$ takes in a query $$ q $$, a prompt $$ p $$, and a knowledge base $$ K $$, producing a refined response $$ r $$.

3. **Iterative Prompting Loop**:
   - The iterative loop is where the magic happens. It involves back-and-forth communication between the IDA and LLMA. Each time the LLMA generates a response, it is evaluated by the IDA, which then creates a new prompt for further refinement. This process continues until either a satisfactory answer is reached or a maximum number of iterations is completed.
   - This loop can be visualized as a conversation where each participant builds on what the other has said, leading to deeper insights and improved answers.

#### Why Use IoT?

The IoT framework is particularly effective in situations where complex queries require nuanced understanding or where initial responses may lack depth or clarity. It allows for adaptive exploration across different reasoning paths without discarding potentially valuable insights—unlike traditional methods that may generate multiple reasoning paths but ultimately discard most of them.

#### When to use it?

The IoT framework is particularly useful in scenarios where complex queries require nuanced understanding or where initial responses may lack depth or clarity. It's ideal for applications in education, customer support, content generation, and more.

### 2. Getting Started

#### Setting Up Your Environment

To get started with the IoT framework, you'll need to set up your environment correctly:

1. **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (version 3.11 or higher).
2. **Set up OpenAI API:** Obtain your API key from OpenAI and set it as an environment variable. (You can use another model for example ollama/gemma2:2b)
3. **Install Poetry:** If you haven't already, install Poetry by following the instructions on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
4. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository containing the IoT framework code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/iteration_of_thought
   cd iteration_of_thought
   ```
5. **Install Dependencies:** Use Poetry to install required packages:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

#### Running the Program

To run the program, you can use the following command within the Poetry environment:

1. **Activate the Poetry Shell:**
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```
2. **Run the Main Script:**
   ```bash
   python src/iot_agent/main.py --method AIoT --query "Your query here" --temperature 0.5
   ```

   You can specify the method (`AIoT` or `GIoT`), the query, and the sampling temperature for the LLM response.

#### Understanding the Code Structure

The provided code consists of several key components:

- **IterationOfThought Class:** This class manages the iteration process using specified models and includes methods for both AIoT and GIoT.
- **Methods:** 
  - `_call_llm`: Handles API calls to an LLLM service.
  - `inner_dialogue_agent`: Generates new prompts based on previous responses to refine the output.
  - `llm_agent`: Combines the user query with the generated prompt to produce a refined response.
  - `stopping_criterion`: Determines when to stop iterating based on the content of the response.
  - `aiot`: Implements the Autonomous Iteration of Thought process.
  - `giot`: Implements the Guided Iteration of Thought process.

### 3. Code Explanation

#### Main Components

1. **Imports and Configuration:**
   The code begins by importing necessary libraries and setting up configuration variables, including the OpenAI API key and model type.

   ```python
   import os
   import time
   import signal
   from typing import Optional
   from loguru import logger
   import click
   from rich.console import Console
   from rich.panel import Panel
   from rich.progress import Progress, SpinnerColumn, TextColumn
   from rich.prompt import Prompt
   from rich.table import Table
   from rich.markdown import Markdown
   from litellm import completion
   import requests  # Added for handling URL requests
   ```

2. **API Key Handling:**
   The API key is retrieved from the environment variables. If it is not set, an error is raised.

   ```python
   API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
   if not API_KEY:
       raise ValueError("OpenAI API key must be set as an environment variable.")
   ```

3. **IterationOfThought Class:**
   This class encapsulates the logic for both AIoT and GIoT methods. It initializes with parameters such as the model type, maximum iterations, timeout settings, and temperature.

   ```python
   class IterationOfThought:
       def __init__(self, model: str = MODEL, max_iterations: int = 5, timeout: int = 30, temperature: float = 0.5):
           self.model = model
           self.max_iterations = max_iterations
           self.timeout = timeout
           self.temperature = temperature
   ```

4. **API Call Method:**
   The `_call_llm` method handles the interaction with the OpenAI API, including error handling for rate limits.

   ```python
   def _call_llm(self, prompt: str, temperature: Optional[float] = None, max_retries: int = 3) -> str:
       for _ in range(max_retries):
           try:
               with console.status(f"[bold green]Calling {self.model} API...", spinner="dots"):
                   response = completion(
                       model=self.model,
                       temperature=temperature or self.temperature,
                       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
                   )
               return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"].strip()
           except Exception as e:
               console.print(f"[red]Error: {e}")
               return ""
       console.print("[red]Failed to get a response from OpenAI API after max retries")
       return ""
   ```

5. **Inner Dialogue Agent:**
   This method generates a new prompt based on the previous response, encouraging deeper reasoning.

   ```python
   def inner_dialogue_agent(self, query: str, previous_response: str) -> str:
       prompt = (
           f"Given the original query: '{query}' and the previous response: '{previous_response}', "
           "generate an instructive and context-specific prompt to refine and improve the answer."
       )
       return self._call_llm(prompt)
   ```

6. **AIoT and GIoT Methods:**
   The `aiot` method implements the autonomous iteration process, while the `giot` method follows a fixed number of iterations.

   ```python
   def aiot(self, query: str) -> str:
       # Implementation of AIoT
   ```

   ```python
   def giot(self, query: str, fixed_iterations: int) -> str:
       # Implementation of GIoT
   ```

7. **User Interaction:**
   The `get_user_query` function prompts the user for input, allowing for a sample query or a custom one.

   ```python
   def get_user_query() -> str:
       user_input = Prompt.ask("Query", default=sample_query)
       return user_input
   ```

8. **Main Function:**
   The `main` function orchestrates the execution of the program, handling user input and displaying results.

   ```python
   @click.command()
   @click.option("--method", type=click.Choice(["AIoT", "GIoT", "both"]), default="AIoT", help="Choose the method to run")
   def main(method: str) -> None:
       # Main execution logic
   ```

### 4. Examples of IoT in Action

#### Simple Example: Basic Query Handling

Let's start with a simple example using AIoT:

```python
sample_query = "What is the capital of France?"
final_response_aiot = iot.aiot(sample_query)
print(final_response_aiot)
```

In this example, we ask a straightforward question about France's capital. The AI will generate an initial response and refine it through iterations until it reaches a satisfactory answer.

#### Intermediate Example: Refining Responses

Now let's look at an intermediate example using GIoT:

```python
sample_query = "Explain photosynthesis."
final_response_giot = iot.giot(sample_query, fixed_iterations=3)
print(final_response_giot)
```

Here, we are asking for an explanation of photosynthesis over three iterations, allowing us to obtain a more detailed understanding each time.

#### Advanced Example: Complex Query Iteration

For our advanced example, let's tackle a more complex query:

```python
sample_query = "Describe the impact of climate change on marine biodiversity."
final_response_aiot = iot.aiot(sample_query)
print(final_response_aiot)
```

This query might require multiple iterations for deeper insights into various aspects related to climate change and marine life.
